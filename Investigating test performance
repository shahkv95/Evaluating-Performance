% You can determine how many of the test images the network correctly classified by comparing the predicted classification with the 
known classification. The known classifications are stored in the Labels property of the datastore.

You can use logical comparison and the nnz function to determine the number of elements of two arrays that match:
numequal = nnz(a == b)

Calculate the fraction of test images correctly classified

The confusionchart function calculates and displays the confusion matrix for the predicted classifications.
confusionchart(knownclass,predictedclass)
The (j,k) element of the confusion matrix is a count of how many images from class j the network predicted to be in class k.
Hence, diagonal elements represent correct classifications; off-diagonal elements represent misclassifications.
