#
The variable info is a structure containing information on the training. The fields TrainingLoss and TrainingAccuracy contain a 
record of the performance of the network on the training data at each iteration.
#


#
This code loads the training information of flowernet.
load pathToImages
load trainedFlowerNetwork flowernet info
#

#
Plot training loss
#
     plot(info.TrainingLoss())
      
#
This code creates a datastore of the flower images.
#

    dsflowers = imageDatastore(pathToImages,'IncludeSubfolders',true,'LabelSource','foldernames');
    [trainImgs,testImgs] = splitEachLabel(dsflowers,0.98);
  
# Classify images
The network appears to be performing well on the training data, but the real test is how well it performs on the test data.
#
    flwrPreds = classify(flowernet,testImgs)
